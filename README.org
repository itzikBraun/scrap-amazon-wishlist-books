#+TITLE: Export Books from an Amazon Wishlist to YAML

I didn't test it in a while so it's possible it won't work with the current Amazon wishlist page. I only tested it (a while ago) on the German domain.

I used it in order to back up my wishlist and have it in another place that is not Amazon.

* Setup

Install packages using requirements file, version are not set, have fun resolving issues.

* Usage

- Backup current lists if you plan to override them, the page might have changed and problems might occur.
- Save Amazon wishlist as HTML page.
- Run the following command
#+begin_src sh
./grab_books_from_amazon_wishlist.py books.html books.yaml "historiography-books"
#+end_src

Result:
#+begin_src yaml

As you can see the result isn't great, the ISBN can be a string or an int (not sure why I didn't fix it) and the order of properties is not easy to read.
But it's better than nothing.
